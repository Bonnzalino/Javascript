//do-while loop practice:
// Write a function that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high, the function should tell the user to guess lower. If the user's guess is too low, the function should tell the user to guess higher. The function should continue prompting the user to guess the number until they guess correctly.
